    <h1>Welcome to Madman's Boxing Basics!</h1>

    <p>Here you will learn the basic punches in boxing: jab, straight, hook, and uppercut. My favorite and current fighting style is the Slugger/Pressure fighter.</p>
    
    <p>Founded by Migz "Madman" Antonio, an amateur boxer with a record of 5 wins and no losses in the light heavyweight division. I have an upcoming amateur championship match sometime this year!</p>
